# pjs-project1
I made this to try and host one of my projects on github!
Note: I had trouble cloning the project so if you want to see that program, go to this link:
https://26arajesh.github.io/pjs-project1/pjs.main/
You cannot get rid of the /pjs.main at the end or it will direct you to the README.md by default.
